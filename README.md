## About The Project

![Screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvoj90vcy/image/upload/v1655106480/gatsby-tailwind-starter/homepage_f5wim3.jpg)

Recently there are lots of great Gatsby projects that are built with TailwindCSS. This project is a Gatsby starter that is built with TailwindCSS.
I made this one for myself but I also wanted to share it with others. So I made this project.

Here's why:

* I wanted to learn how to use TailwindCSS with Gatsby.
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over again like setting up TailwindCSS and creating a Gatsby starter.
* Start coding ASAP :smile:

## Built With

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Getting Started

Lets get started using this template.

### Prerequisites

Install NPM first

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

Install the Gatsby CLI:

```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

## Usage

Create a new Gatsby project using this starter:

```sh
gatsby new my-new-website https://github.com/radenadri/gatsby-tailwindcss-starter
```

Build a stylesheet from your Tailwind CSS config and run the project in development mode:

```sh
cd my-new-website
npm run develop
```

Build your website for production:

```sh
npm run build
```
